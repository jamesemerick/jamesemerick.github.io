In an attempt to post more, I'm starting a series called "What I'm Reading."

I try to read a decent amount and at any given time I'm usually in the middle 
of a number of books. To motivate myself to read more (and get some tracking), the last 
few years I've set goals for the number of books I'd like to accomplish for the year. Last year's 
total was fifteen books and thanks to a number of generous gifts and intercontinental flights, a late
December reading surge set the 2023 total at nineteen books read. 

This year the goal is twenty books. With three complete and five currently in progress. 

Complete:
1. Same as Ever, by Morgan Housel 
2. Speak like Churchill, Stand like Lincoln, James C. Humes
3. "Death's End", Cixin Liu 

In-progress
- "Built to Move", Kelly and Juliet Starret
- "Four Steps to Epiphany", Steve Black
- "The High Sierra", Kim Stanley Robinson
- "The Crux",
