Hi, I'm James!

From a young age, I loved building and creating. In my childhood, that manifested in
intricate Lego structures and family woodworking projects. In college, I studied
Mechanical Engineering, spending many days and nights in the machine shop and
electronics lab. Early in my career, I designed and built next-generation 5G wireless
antenna systems at a telecommunications startup. Later, I helped to develop and deploy 
autonomous earth-moving robots at startup Built Robotics. In my last role I had the opportunity
to collaborate with an extremeley talented and multidisciplinary team researching and building 
adapative robotics systems at Autodesk Research. 

Along the way, I discovered and cultivated a passion for building systems at the
intersection of hardware, software, and the cutting edge of what is possible. Most
importantly, though, I am excited by getting those systems out of the lab and doing
useful work in the real world.

I am now the co-founder of [Cosmic Robotics](https://www.cosmicrobotics.com/) where we are building 
robots to enable autonomous construction on Earth and beyond. We're in the early stages and I couldn't 
be more excited to build.

Outside the office, I love being active, especially in nature. 
Lately, that means long hikes or climbs in the Sierra Nevada. 
Rock climbing is in the middle of a Venn diagram of physically, mentally, and technically challenging. 
It requires constant learning, creativity, and preparation. 
It also helps that climbing can take you to some of the most beautiful places on Earth.

When not climbing, I can be found wandering the Potrero Hill neighborhood of San
Francisco or reading. When not eating salads at home, I can be found scouring the Bay
Area for pizza that doesn't insult my NY-native sensibilities or a burrito that can live
up to Honest Tom's (RIP) from Philly. I'm open to recommendations on either, but please submit
a CV with your food critic credentials so I can determine if you can be trusted.

This site is an experiment. A random assortment of posts and musings. Feel free to
follow along and reach out!
