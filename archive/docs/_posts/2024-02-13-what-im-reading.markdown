In an attempt to post more, I'm starting a series called "What I'm Reading."

I try to read a decent amount and at any given time I'm usually in the middle 
of a number of books. To motivate myself to read more (and get some tracking), the last 
few years I've set goals for the number of books I'd like to accomplish for the year. Last year's 
total was fifteen books and thanks to a number of generous gifts and intercontinental flights, a late
December reading surge set the 2023 total at nineteen books read. 

This year's goal is twenty books. With three complete and four currently in progress.
