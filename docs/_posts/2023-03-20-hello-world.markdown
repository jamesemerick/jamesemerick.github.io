My personal website has experienced fits and starts over the years. Originally a
[WordPress](https://wordpress.com) portfolio site, then a
[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/) and Python webapp, now a
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) site hosted with [GitHub
Pages](https://pages.github.com).

This is the first of _(hopefully)_ many posts in this new era. Future entries will follow
the theme of "whatever gets me to actually post." They could be technology or
work-related, but also potentially related to traveling, rock climbing, or random
musings.

Feel free to follow along the adventure. In the mean time, feel free to reach out!

And stayed tuned for more...

{% highlight python %}
def hello_world() -> None:
    print("Hello, world.")

hello_world()

>>> Hello, world.
